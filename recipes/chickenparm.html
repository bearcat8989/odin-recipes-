    <h2 class="Description">DESCRIPTION
    <p>Chicken Parmesan is an ultimate comfort food that combines all the best flavors and textures in one dish. The juicy, tender chicken, perfectly breaded and fried to a crisp, gets smothered in rich marinara sauce, adding a savory, tangy element that balances the whole plate. Then, of course, there's the gooey, melted mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses on top, which bring a creamy, salty richness that makes each bite unforgettable. Paired with pasta or on its own, chicken parm has that irresistible mix of crunch, sauce, and cheese that just hits the spot every time. It’s the perfect blend of satisfying and indulgent, making it a go-to comfort meal.</p></h2>
